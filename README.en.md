# RealisticChicken

RealisticChicken is a lightweight Paper/Spigot plugin that makes chicken breeding more realistic by using fertilized eggs to spawn chicks and infertile eggs for automatic egg drops.

## Features

- Fertilized eggs can hatch into chicks.
- Infertile eggs are dropped automatically by chickens.
- Breeding still gives vanilla-equivalent experience (1–7 XP).
- Chickens enter a 5-minute cooldown after breeding.
- Supports Paper, Spigot, Bukkit.
- Compatible with Minecraft 1.21.5~1.21.11.
- No dependencies required.
- Supports multiple languages for egg descriptions.

## How it works

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Feed seeds → Chick appears instantly.
- Eggs are laid automatically over time.

**RealisticChicken:**
- Feed seeds → Eggs are laid.
- Throw the fertilized eggs to hatch chicks.
- Infertile eggs drop automatically over time.

This provides a more immersive and realistic farming experience.
